## Priceonomics - What Do People Pawn?

https://priceonomics.com/heres-what-people-pawn-across-america/

I like the contrast of the colors.  Its easy to tell them all apart, except for the light yellow and light green.    

It seems they have given the darkest colors to represent the things most frequently pawned, with guns, vehicles and antiques being the most frequent and each being one of the darker colors.

One issue with the analysis is that it gives the impression that guns are the most frequently pawned, and thats true but only on a state basis.  It would be interesting to see what is most frequently pawned if state population is taken into account.  For example, Montana and Alaska are red "gun pawning" states, yet they both have fairly low populations. 

## Priceonomics - Which Car Brands Have the Most Loyal Owners?

I like the organization from largest at the top to the smallest at the bottom.  On a website you scroll down, reaching the top first, so that makes sense.  

I like the clean layout, not a lot of distraction on the graph.  

The graph has bars and numbers representing %loyal.  That is a bit redundant.  

## Priceonomics - The United States of Sexy

https://priceonomics.com/the-united-states-of-sex-a-survey-of-17000-women/

The first graph in the article shows percent of women who perceive themselves as sexy, organized by state.  I like their use of darkness and lightness with darker color corresponding with greater percentages. The low percentage states are so light in color that they seem empty.  

I like the inclusion at the bottom of the graph of the specifics of the sample.  

One thing I don't like is how small Alaska is down there.  In real life its 1/3 the size of the rest of the US!


## Priceonomics - When Is the Most Popular Time to Get Married?

https://priceonomics.com/whats-the-most-popular-time-of-year-to-get-married/

Check out the graph partway down the page titled "What are the Most Common Weeks to Get married in the United States".

I like the standard time series style.  

I like that they truncated the y axis (0% to 4.5%) to focus in on the data.

You have to check the date for each point of interest.  It might be helpful to block out months somehow, with major tick marks on the x axis or different colors.  That way you can get at least month info much more easily.
